					<h3>Application Service Engineer @ Siemens</h3>
				</summary>
				<p class="experience-description">
					It was my first experience working in development after studying it was where I had more opportunities to learn. In
					this project I was the only software developer in the team. The purpose was to build an interface between old,
					sometimes mechanical, traffic controllers and a state of the art traffic management central system. As
					expected some functions and data-collection would be unavailable or limited.
					We achieved a production ready solution, comprised of a microcontroller programmed in C, connected via VPN to
					a server application developed in Java and running in a Linux server. The server application managed the
					incoming data and relaid it to the central system using a SOAP based protocol. Besides developing the server
					application from scratch, I was also responsible for the production of the devices, large scale testing and
					deployment of the field test units.
					During this time I also contributed to another project focused on providing an internal platform for
					day-to-day bureaucratic processes. Helped improve the usability tests and made some improvements.

					<h3>Usability Analyst & Manual QA @ Kwan</h3>
				</summary>
				<p class="experience-description">
					On a first step my role was as Usability Analyst on AMA, a government company that works on bureaucratic
					process digitalization.
					I was tasked with analysing and reporting performance and UI problems or improvements on a government web
					platform that provides public services. The focus was on web technologies and UI good practices following W3C
					standards.

					Within this consultancy company I also worked for Collab, this company develops software for call centres. I
					was
					responsible for testing the administrative platform as well as the functionalities around calls, from
					simulating network problems to codec compatibility.
					The technologies I worked with more frequently were SIP, Flash, Windows Servers, SQL and multiple front-end
					and back-end technologies. For version control and testing we used windows tools (VSTS, Azure, etc).
