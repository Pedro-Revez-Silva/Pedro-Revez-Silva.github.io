            It was my first experience working in development after studying it
            was where I had more opportunities to learn. In this project I was
            the only software developer in the team. The purpose was to build an
            interface between old, sometimes mechanical, traffic controllers and
            a state of the art traffic management central system. As expected
            some functions and data-collection would be unavailable or limited.
            We achieved a production ready solution, comprised of a
            microcontroller programmed in C, connected via VPN to a server
            application developed in Java and running in a Linux server. The
            server application managed the incoming data and relaid it to the
            central system using a SOAP based protocol. Besides developing the
            server application from scratch, I was also responsible for the
            production of the devices, large scale testing and deployment of the
            field test units. During this time I also contributed to another
            project focused on providing an internal platform for day-to-day
            bureaucratic processes. Helped improve the usability tests and made
            some improvements.

            On a first step my role was as Usability Analyst on AMA, a
            government company that works on bureaucratic process
            digitalization. I was tasked with analysing and reporting
            performance and UI problems or improvements on a government web
            platform that provides public services. The focus was on web
            technologies and UI good practices following W3C standards. Within
            this consultancy company I also worked for Collab, this company
            develops software for call centres. I was responsible for testing
            the administrative platform as well as the functionalities around
            calls, from simulating network problems to codec compatibility. The
            technologies I worked with more frequently were SIP, Flash, Windows
            Servers, SQL and multiple front-end and back-end technologies. For
            version control and testing we used windows tools (VSTS, Azure,
            etc).

              Started by using Codeceptjs since it was the tool that was
              implemented already, but it was replaced by Cypress in JS and then
              in TS. For API testing the main tool was Postman with assertions
              and logic in JS. The API was moved into REST following the OpenAPI
              standard and the tests moved into Playwright. I used this tool to automate some regression tests and to test features that required creating a lot of data.

              Implement API Testing tool. Originally started to use Postman,
              moved to mocha & chai.
