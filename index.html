        <ul class="experience-description">
          <p>
            Trakx is a company that provides a platform for trading crypto based assets, as such
            its important to ensure all operations are reliable and secure. My main focus was to 
            implement and maintain a test suite that would ensure the reliability of the platform.
            
            The main challenges were to test the whole application (E2E & API) given that it was a complex system with ever
            changing values and patterns. Any tests to such platforms have to be reliable and dynamic. Along with this 
            I also implemented a system to monitor unexpected price changes or missing data in real time and report them to the team
            via slack.
          </p>
          <li>
           Playwright in TypeScript for both E2E tests and API tests.

        <ul class="experience-description">
          <p>
            Started by using Codeceptjs since it was the tool that was
            implemented already, but it was replaced by Cypress in JS and then
            in TS. For API testing the main tool was Postman with assertions
            and logic in JS. The API was moved into REST following the OpenAPI
            standard and the tests moved into Playwright. I used this tool to
            automate some regression tests and to test features that required
            creating a lot of data.
          </p>
          <li>
            Implement solutions to reduce test flakiness and improve test
            coverage.
          </li>
          <li>Map and Test API endpoints.</li>
          <li>
            Implement API Testing tool. Originally started to use Postman,
            moved to mocha & chai.
          </li>
          <li>Tests run in CircleCI or locally. GitHub actions replaced CircleCI.</li>
          <li>
            Implemented a script to monitor third party APIs (GitHub Actions) and report issues
            to PagerDuty.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added a feature to the Admin Panel web app to create E2E valid and
            producible test orders without having to manually create them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Built test scripts for regression tests and to generate test data using real
            endpoints or the UI using Playwright in TS.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented a script to monitor service versions and report releases to QA. This was
            done to ensure new releases were correctly deployed in production.
          </li>
          <li>
            Made some Dev experience improvements by making is easier choose which services to release.

            Design and development of an automated test suite focused on the internal and public API.

            to test data sources. I also helped improve the CI/CD pipeline and the documentation for

          On a first step my role was as Usability Analyst on AMA, a
          government company that works on bureaucratic process
          digitalization. I was tasked with analysing and reporting
          performance and UI problems or improvements on a government web
          platform that provides public services. The focus was on web
          technologies and UI good practices following W3C standards. Within
          this consultancy company I also worked for Collab, this company
          develops software for call centres. I was responsible for testing
          the administrative platform as well as the functionalities around
          calls, from simulating network problems to codec compatibility. The
          technologies I worked with more frequently were SIP, Flash, Windows
          Servers, SQL and multiple front-end and back-end technologies. For
          version control and testing we used windows tools (VSTS, Azure,
          etc).

        <p class="experience-description">
          It was my first experience working in development after studying it
          was where I had more opportunities to learn. In this project I was
          the only software developer in the team. The purpose was to build an
          interface between old, sometimes mechanical, traffic controllers and
          a state of the art traffic management central system. As expected
          some functions and data-collection would be unavailable or limited.
          We achieved a production ready solution, comprised of a
          microcontroller programmed in C, connected via VPN to a server
          application developed in Java and running in a Linux server. The
          server application managed the incoming data and relaid it to the
          central system using a SOAP based protocol. Besides developing the
          server application from scratch, I was also responsible for the
          production of the devices, large scale testing and deployment of the
          field test units. During this time I also contributed to another
          project focused on providing an internal platform for day-to-day
          bureaucratic processes. Helped improve the usability tests and made
          some improvements.
